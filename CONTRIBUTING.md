## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here\'s how to set up [polar2wgs84]{.title-ref} for local development.

1. Fork the [polar2wgs84]{.title-ref} repo on
   Gitlab.

2. Clone your fork locally:

    ```shell
    $ git clone https://gitlab.cnes.fr/pdssp/common/polar2wgs84.git
    ```

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have
   virtualenv installed, this is how you set up your fork for local
   development:

   ``` shell
    $ cd polar2wgs84/
    $ make prepare-dev
    $ source .venv/bin/activate/
    $ make install-dev
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ``` shell
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you\'re done making changes, check that your changes pass
   flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with
   tox:

   ``` shell
    $ make lint
    $ make tests
    $ tox
   ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to Gitlab:

    ``` shell
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the Gitlab website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
    Put your new functionality in your commit message.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

``` shell
$ pytest tests.test_polar2wgs84
```

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy. Make sure all your
changes are committed. Then run:

``` shell
git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "my version 1.4.0"
```
