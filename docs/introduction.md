## Context

The goal is to project a geometry defined on a spherical surface (e.g., a 3D globe or ellipsoid) into the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system (CRS). This projection is necessary to ensure compatibility with SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) items, which require geometries in WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for geospatial interoperability.
